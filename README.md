# DBus compass example
Server outputs the parameter of the compass position using DBus interface (parameter is supposed to be a number, some kind of rotation degree). The client is an application that connects to the server's DBus and changes the compass parameters in GUI with some timeout. Server's interface was autogenerated by qdbusxml2cpp command.
